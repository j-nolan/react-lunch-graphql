# React Lunch Presentation

This is the repository for the May 29th EPFL React Lunch presentation about GraphQL and the Apollo client for React.

- The `presentation` directory contains the slides of the presentation.

`cd presentation && npm install && npm start`

- The `server` directory contains a basic server that serves mocked tweets. It also serves as a basic example of how to implement a basic GraphQL server using `express` and `express-graphql`.

`cd server && npm install && npm start`
